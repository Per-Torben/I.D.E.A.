<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Generates a comprehensive security report of privileged accounts including role assignments, PIM eligibility, 
    MFA status, and risk assessment based on authentication methods and Restricted AU protection.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script connects to Microsoft Graph and analyzes all principals (users, service principals, groups) 
    with privileged role assignments to identify security risks and compliance gaps.
    
    WHAT IT DETECTS:
    - Active (permanent) role assignments
    - PIM (Privileged Identity Management) eligible role assignments  
    - Group-based role assignments (via role-assignable groups)
    - PIM group eligibility (users eligible to activate membership in role-assignable groups)
    - MFA authentication methods for each privileged user
    - Restricted Administrative Unit (RMAU) protection status
    
    WHY IT CHECKS THESE:
    - Privileged accounts are high-value targets requiring the strongest security controls
    - Phone/SMS-based MFA is vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks
    - Restricted Administrative Units prevent lateral movement and privilege escalation
    - The combination of weak MFA + no RMAU protection = critical security risk
    
    SECURITY RISK ASSESSMENT:
    The script calculates risk levels based on two critical security factors:
    
    1. MFA Method Security:
       - SECURE: FIDO2, Microsoft Authenticator (push notification), Windows Hello, Software OATH
       - VULNERABLE: Phone/SMS authentication (susceptible to SIM swapping)
       - CRITICAL: No MFA enabled
    
    2. Restricted Administrative Unit (RMAU) Protection:
       - PROTECTED: User is member of a restricted AU (isMemberManagementRestricted = true)
       - UNPROTECTED: User is not in any restricted AU
    
    RISK LEVELS EXPLAINED:
    - ✅ LOW RISK (Fully Secure): Strong MFA (no phone) + RMAU protection
         Example: FIDO2 or Authenticator app + member of restricted AU
         
    - ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK (Single Issue): Either vulnerable MFA OR missing RMAU protection
         - Phone MFA Only: Phone/SMS MFA but protected by RMAU
         - No AU Only: Strong MFA but not in restricted AU
         
    - 🚨 HIGH RISK (Multiple Issues): Phone/SMS MFA + No RMAU protection
         Example: SMS-based MFA without restricted AU membership
         This combination provides minimal protection against sophisticated attacks
         
    - ❓ UNKNOWN RISK: MFA status cannot be determined (missing permissions or RAU access)
    
    Output is account-focused, showing each principal's complete privilege profile with 
    security status, risk indicators, and detailed authentication method analysis.

.PARAMETER LogDirectory
    Directory path for log files. Defaults to .\Logs

.PARAMETER IncludeGroups
    Include group-based role assignments and PIM group eligibility. Defaults to $true.
    Set to $false to exclude group-related privileged access from the report.

.PARAMETER ReturnData
    When specified, returns data objects instead of displaying report. Useful for storing results in variables.

.PARAMETER UseInteractiveAuth
    Use interactive authentication instead of app-based authentication.
    When not specified, assumes app-based (certificate or client secret) authentication is already established.

.EXAMPLE
    # First establish Graph connection with app-based auth, then run the report:
    .\Get-PrivilegedAccountReport.ps1
    Runs the report, displays on-screen summary, and prompts for CSV export.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Get-PrivilegedAccountReport.ps1 -IncludeGroups
    Includes group-based role assignments in the report.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Get-PrivilegedAccountReport.ps1 -UseInteractiveAuth
    Uses interactive authentication (prompts for credentials).

.EXAMPLE
    $results = .\Get-PrivilegedAccountReport.ps1 -ReturnData
    Stores results in variable for analysis. Access with $results.Users and $results.Summary

.NOTES
    Authentication:
    - Default: Uses app-based authentication (certificate or client secret)
    - Alternative: Use -UseInteractiveAuth for interactive login
    
    IMPORTANT - Interactive Authentication Limitation:
    When using interactive authentication (-UseInteractiveAuth), MFA status reporting may be incomplete
    if privileged users are members of Restricted Administrative Units (RAUs) and the interactive user
    does not have access to those RAUs. App-only authentication is recommended for complete reporting.
    
    Portability:
    This script is designed to work across any Microsoft Entra ID tenant without modification.
    - No hardcoded tenant IDs, domain names, or resource identifiers
    - All role and group discovery is dynamic via Microsoft Graph API
    - Log and export paths use relative directories (.\Logs by default)
    - Works with both certificate-based and interactive authentication
    
    Required Microsoft Graph API permissions (Application):
    - User.Read.All
    - Directory.Read.All
    - RoleManagement.Read.Directory
    - RoleEligibilitySchedule.Read.Directory
    - UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All
    - PrivilegedAccess.Read.AzureADGroup (for PIM group eligibility detection)
